# ðŸ¤– Telegram-Twitter-bot

Let's build a Twitter bot for Telegram.  All of your main public tweets will be imported into your Telegram group! For an example of this in action check out the great work that Pieter Levels.io has done with his group. https://t.co/SVSZa2qfac


## We will start with NodeJS

one option: `brew search node`

another https://github.com/creationix/nvm

and a third https://nodejs.org/en/


## To begin to build the bot:

`npm docs node-telegram-bot-api` -- pop up the docs in the browser

`npm install node-telegram-bot-api` -- install the bot




## Use the Botfather to built it:

Message `@botfather` on Telegram
